<p>This is an extension of the previous exercise.</p>
<p>The goal is the same, but now you need to create widgets for the waiting mode and the clicking mode. You will also need to write the code to switch between them and to collect the outputs appropriately.</p>
<p>You should fill out this function:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="ot">widgetHoldExercise ::</span> <span class="dt">MonadWidget</span> t m
                   <span class="ot">=&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Event</span> t <span class="dt">Bool</span>
                   <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> m (<span class="dt">Dynamic</span> t <span class="dt">Int</span>)
widgetHoldExercise eClickable <span class="fu">=</span>
  pure (pure <span class="dv">0</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>to make this happen.</p>
