The goal of this exercise is to make one of the little counter widgets that we've dealt with a few times in the past.

We'll need

- an "Add" button in a `div`
- a "Reset" button in a `div`
- the current count displayed in a `div`

You should open
`~/reflex-workshop/code/src/Workshop/DOM/Elements/Button/Exercise.hs `
and fill out this function:

```haskell
buttonExercise :: MonadWidget t m
               => m ()
buttonExercise =
  pure ()
```

to make this happen.
