We are going to extend on the previous exercise in 
`~/reflex-workshop/code/src/Todo/Exercise/List.hs`
to add the ability to remove TODO items from the list when their remove `Event`s fire.

You should open
`~/reflex-workshop/code/src/Todo/Exercise/List.hs `
and make the changes required to make this happen.
