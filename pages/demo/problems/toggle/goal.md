In this exercise we are going to modify a Haskell file to get an idea of how this workshop is going to proceed.

You should open `src/Workshop/Demo/Problems/Toggle/Exercise.hs` in your editor:

```haskell
toggleExercise1 :: Text
toggleExercise1 = 
  "FIXME"

toggleExercise2 :: Text
toggleExercise2 = 
  "FIXME"
```

and then click the "Progress" button.
