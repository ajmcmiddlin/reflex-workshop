Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) is a style of writing code that handles time-varying state and IO using a highly expressive set of abstractions.

The styles of FRP that interest me are based on `Event` and `Behavior` types, and have APIs derived from a clear semantics.
This leads to APIs that compose well and are easy to reason about.

The `reflex` library is one of these libraries.
My claim is that it has the best mix of features, usability and performance of any of the implementations out there.

We're going to learn quite a bit about FRP and `reflex` today, so I'll leave the rest of the explanations to the content itself.
