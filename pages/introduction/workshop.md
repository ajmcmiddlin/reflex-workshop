This workshop is design to get you up and running with `reflex`.

The information will be mostly delivered by the presenters, but there are some explanations in these pages for those who want to try to race ahead.

The whole workshop is an application which is running in `ghcid`.
The application will reload itself whenever you modify and save any of the source files.
Some extra magic has been added so that your web browser will refresh when that happens, and we're saving some state in the background so that you don't lose your place in the workshop when that happens.

The exercises all have 3 panels:

- there is an explanation of the goal of the exercise
- there is a panel that will display the results of your exercise and the results of our solution to the exercise
- there is a panel that will step through one or more versions of our solution

There is also a button to mark the exercise as "Done" so you don't have to look at it anymore.

Occasionally these exercises will build on each other, so you should try to complete them in order.

So for the most part we'll be chatting with you, and you'll be editing some code to try to make it behave in the expected way.
